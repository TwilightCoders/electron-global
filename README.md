# electron-runtime

A complete solution to build a ready for distribution, lightweight Electron app for Windows, macOS and Linux with auto updater support. Instead of bundling Electron with each app, electron-runtime will use a global installation of the newest Electron.

# Electron version

electron-runtime will always keep up with the newest global Electron version for all apps, but it will support APIs of up to 2 earlier major versions.
